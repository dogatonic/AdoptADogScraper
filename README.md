# AdoptADogScraper
Node.js web scraper that checks for new dogs up for adoption.

This project served 2 purposes. One, I wanted to write a node script that ran a continuous loop in a way similar to a previous a project I did in a multi-user online educational game. Two, I was looking to adopt a new dog from a particular adoption agency I like, so I want to scrape their site looking for dog updates 'round the clock.

In the end, the loop worked great, though it's application here was not really necessary. The scraper also worked great and I used IFTTT to send notifications to my phone.
